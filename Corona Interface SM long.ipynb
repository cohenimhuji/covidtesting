    "### 1. What does this code do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- This code replicates Figure 6 in Berger, Herkenhoff, Mongey (2020) - *An SEIR Infectious Disease Model with Testing and Conditional Quarantine\".\n",
    "- To replicate this figure for a number of different levels of $\\tau$, scroll down and click **[Run model]**. \n",
    "- The code will take ~45s to run the model, and then display **\"Done solving model\"**\n",
    "- Click **[Show panel chart]** to display the figure\n",
    "- Accompanying the figure will be a slider for $\\tau \\in [0,0.05]$ (so, from zero to 10 times the value used in the paper), that can be moved to change the plot\n",
    "- Below we describe the other parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What can I change?\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two sets of parameters that the user can change\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Preset parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set appear in Table 4 of the paper, and below are divided into three blocks\n",
    "1. **Quarantine parameters**\n",
    "    - $\\xi^u\\geq 0$ \n",
    "        - Baseline rate of quarantine that is used in the *Common quarantine* case\n",
    "    - $\\lambda^Q/\\lambda\\in[0,1]$ \n",
    "        - Effectiveness of quarantine. If equal to 1, then quarantine has no effect. We suggest in the paper that for Wuhan this is around 0.10, and use 0.50 as our baseline for counterfacutals\n",
    "    - $A_{rel}\\in[0,1]$ \n",
    "        - Relative productivity of asymptomatic quarantined individuals to asymptomatic non-quarantined individuals. \n",
    "             $$ Y_t = M_t^{A,NQ} + A_{rel}\\times M_t^{A,Q} $$\n",
    "        - If this is lower, then *Common quarantine* policy will lead to larger declines in output relative to *Targeted quarantine* policies.\n",
    "1. **Disease parameters**\n",
    "    - Number of initial infections in the US population\n",
    "    - $\\pi^D$ \n",
    "        - Gives the rate at which *symptomatic* individuals die from the virus\n",
    "1. **Timing parameters**\n",
    "    - Date of vaccine - In the paper we set this to 500 days\n",
    "    - $1/\\delta$\n",
    "        - Gives the number of days that it takes, on average, to show symptoms once infected with the virus\n",
    "    - $1/\\omega^R$\n",
    "        - Gives the number of days that it takes, on average, to recover from the virus\n",
    "1. **Contagion parameters**\n",
    "    - $R_0$\n",
    "        - This is the baseline transmission rate. In the code $\\rho^S$---the probability of infection conditional on meeting---is chosen to imply this level of $R_0$\n",
    "   - $\\rho^A/\\rho^S$\n",
    "        - This is measures the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals. A meeting with a symptomatic individual results in infection with probability $\\rho^S$. If $\\rho^A/\\rho^S=0.5$, then half as many meetings with asymptomatic individuals result in infection. In the paper we simply set this to 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### ii. Policy parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set appear in Tables 5 and 6 of the paper, these are the very simply 'policy parameters' $\\tau\\geq 0$ and $\\Delta\\in[0,1]$ which represent the rate of daily testing and the slackening of quarantine measures that we use to construct our counterfactual.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chooses one of the two parameters to *Slide over*\n",
    "- Set the range for the other parameter. \n",
    "    - When sliding over $\\Delta$, the *upper value* is always 1, which represents no slackening of quarantine. User then chooses the *lower bound*.\n",
    "    - When sliding over $\\tau$, the *lower value* is always 1, which represents no testing. User then chooses the *upper bound*.\n",
    "    - In both cases the grid of parameters that are considered is evenly spaced and has 10 points.\n",
    "- Proceed as above: Click **[Run model]**, wait until it displays **\"Done solving model\"**, then click **[Show panel chart]**\n"
